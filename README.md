# Edric Tom

Hi! I'm @edrictom and I'm currently employed as a Business Technical Support Analyst for the College of Biological Sciences - Dean's Office at UC Davis. Although my work is in technical support, my passion is in coding, especially with an emphasis on mobile applications, specifically iOS.

I am always interested in the new technologies that Apple is developing to making easier for developers to write code in Swift for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS. I keep up to date on all the latest frameworks and APIs to interface with iOS devices in order to keep the apps I build fresh for my users. I want them to experience Apple's latest features using the apps I create.

I am currently learning Swift and SwiftUI through an iOS development course on Codecademy. I already have ideas for my own apps that I want to build, both very ambitious and practical that I hope will challenge my abilities and prove to any future employer that I am an excellent candidate for an iOS Developer position.

You can contact me at edrictom@icloud.com if you want to reach out to collaborate on a project or simply chat about anything iOS development related!
