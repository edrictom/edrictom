# Edric Tom

Hi! I'm @edrictom and I'm employed as an Apprentice Systems Tech at Meta! Although my work is in technical support and systems engineering, my passion is in coding in general, currently with an emphasis on both security engineering and iOS development on the side, using tools such as Swift and SwiftUI.

I am always interested in the new technologies that developers are creating to make programming easier and more accessible for all. I keep up to date on all the latest tools, frameworks, and APIs in order to keep the apps and programs I build fresh for my users. I want them to experience the web's latest features using the apps I create.

I am currently adapting into my role at Meta, pursing trainings in Linux, Python, and systems and security concepts. I have ideas for my own apps that I want to build as well, both very ambitious and practical that I hope will challenge my abilities!

You can contact me at edrictom@icloud.com if you want to reach out to collaborate on a project or simply chat about anything coding related!
