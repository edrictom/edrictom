# Edric Tom

Hi! I'm @edrictom and I'm currently employed as a Lead IT Support Specialist for the College of Biological Sciences - Dean's Office at UC Davis. Although my work is in technical support, my passion is in coding, especially with an emphasis on front-end engineering and UX design, specifically using React and CSS frameworks such as Tailwind.

I am always interested in the new technologies that developers are creating to make front-end development easier. I keep up to date on all the latest frameworks and APIs in order to keep the apps I build fresh for my users. I want them to experience the web's latest features using the apps I create.

I am currently learning web development and React through a Front-End Engineering course on Codecademy. I already have ideas for my own apps and websites that I want to build, both very ambitious and practical that I hope will challenge my abilities and prove to any future employer that I am an excellent candidate for a Front-End Engineer or Web Developer position.

You can contact me at edrictom@icloud.com if you want to reach out to collaborate on a project or simply chat about anything coding related!
